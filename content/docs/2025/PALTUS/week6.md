## Final deliverables

### Project overview
PALTUS is an AI-powered self-learning platform designed to change the way of personalized education. The platform addresses key challenges in modern e-learning by providing:

- Adaptive Learning: AI-driven personalization that adjusts content and pace based on user choices and preferences.
- Flexible Course Creation: Intuitive tools for educators and users to build, modify, and delete custom courses.
- Gamification: Reward systems, achievements, and daily streaks to maintain motivation and track progress.
