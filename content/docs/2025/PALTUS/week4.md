# Practicum Project  
PALTUS team. Report 4

## Testing and QA

### Testing Approach
1. Unit Testing Layer:
- Converters (Tested StringListConverter):
  - Null/empty inputs
  - Single/multi-item handling
  - Whitespace trimming
  - Bidirectional conversion

- Mappers (CourseMapper transformations):
  - Course <-> DTO conversions
  - Lesson/Subtopic mappings
  - Data integrity checks

2. Integration Testing Layer:
- Spring Context Test (application context loading):
  - Spring bean initialization
  - Profile-based configuration
  - Dependency wiring
    
3. API Controller Testing:
- CourseController (Mock-tested REST endpoints):
  - GET /courses (dashboard)
  - GET /courses/{id} (course details)
  - DELETE /courses/{id}
  - POST /courses/saveCourse

## CI/CD
1. Trigger: On push/pull request to main or dev
2. Environment:

   - Ubuntu latest runner
   - Java 17 (Temurin distribution)
   - Spring test profile activation
3. Test Execution:

   - Isolated H2 database for tests
   - Surefire plugin for test reporting
   - Parallel-safe test configuration
4. Quality Gates:

   - Block merge on test failures
   - Artifact upload for test reports
5. Self-hosted CD

## Deployment

### Staging Environment

The staging environment is built by using Docker Compose, providing a setup for final testing before release.

Infrastructure Provisioning:
- PostgreSQL 15 database container
- Spring Boot backend service container
- Frontend application container
- All services connected via Docker network

## Vibe Check

The discussion was done during the least meeting of the 4th week, we are a bit behind the plan and our ambitions and also the tasks are not clearly splitted in a proper way, so we decided to fix that during next meetings.
