## Final deliverables

### Project overview

**DeathRoom Online** is a fast-paced, competitive multiplayer arena shooter inspired by classics like Quake and Call of Duty. The project solves the problem of providing a modern, responsive FPS experience with low-latency online play, fair hit registration, and fun core gameplay without excessive complexity.  
Key implemented features include server-authoritative mechanics, health/armor systems, respawning, live leaderboards, map selection, and a complete documentation set for both client and server.

### Features

- Server-authoritative gameplay logic
- Real-time multiplayer for up to 12+ players
- Player movement (jump, strafe, slide, jump-pads)
- Health, armor, and pick-up system
- Accurate damage and respawn mechanics
- Multiple maps, new spawn point balancing
- Pause menu, health/armor/nickname UI
- Fully documented backend and client architecture

### Tech stack

- **Backend:** .NET (C#), custom UDP networking via LiteNetLib, Docker, GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **Frontend (Game client):** Unity, C#, UI Toolkit
- **Infrastructure:** Docker Compose, manual deployment to VDS (Ubuntu), in-memory game state
- **Docs:** Markdown (C4 model), Google Docs for design

### Setup instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   `git clone https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/DeathRoom.git`
2. **Read deployment instructions in `/docs/README.md`**  
   for full backend/server setup.
3. **Build and run server with Docker Compose:**  
   In project root:  
   `docker-compose up --build`
4. **Build the client in Unity** (instructions in `/docs/client.md`).
5. **Connect the built game client** to the server IP (see Deployment links).
