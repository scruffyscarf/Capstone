# **Week #4** 

## Testing and QA

*Server-side logic now has 7 unit tests covering core request/response handlers and edge-case packet validation. Tests run automatically in the CI workflow on every push and PR to **dev**; the job fails the build if any test breaks. Average code coverage is moderate (exact % not yet exported).*

### Evidence of test execution

## CI/CD

*GitHub Actions workflows build, test and publish Docker images to GHCR.*

* **prod-server-deploy.yml** and **stage-server-deploy.yml** run on **main** and **dev** respectively.  
* Secrets are stored in GitHub Secrets; no credentials are committed.  
* Pipeline steps: run tests ➜ build image ➜ push to GHCR ➜ pull & restart container on target server.  
* Stage (port 8050) and Prod (port 9050) deploy jobs are isolated.  
* Hardening, container health-checks, and secret management implemented in commit `f0a1945e…`.

## Deployment

### Staging

*Automatically built from **dev** and deployed via Docker Compose to 77.233.222.200:8050.*

### Production

*Built from **main** and deployed via Docker Compose to 77.233.222.200:9050 on a hardened VPS.*

## Vibe Check

*Team morale is high. No blockers were reported, collaboration is smooth, and everyone feels heard.*

# Weekly commitments

## Individual contribution of each participant

*All participants: attended calls, decision discussions, retrospectives, and performed code reviews.*

## Plan for Next Week

- [ ] Complete the client-side logic for mutual client-server packet exchange based on UDP
- [ ] Update and finalize the logic for bullet hits and dealing specific damage depending on weapon type, ammunition, hit location, etc.
- [ ] Conduct code review and improve overall performance
- [ ] Systematize and organize the server code architecture to improve code quality and readability
- [ ] Search for and fix bugs, if any are present
- [ ] Improve test coverage, write new tests, and provide more useful information
- [ ] Enhance the project's logging and monitoring system

## Confirmation of the code's operability

We confirm that the code in the main branch:
- [x] In working condition.
- [x] Run via docker-compose (or another alternative described in the README.md).
