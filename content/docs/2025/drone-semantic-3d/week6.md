## Final deliverables

### Project overview

Our project aims to create an autonomous drone system capable of semantic 3D reconstruction and high-fidelity mapping. This week, we enhanced our technical stack by integrating `pg-vector`, refining the webcam simulation for improved realism, and implemented the foundational version of an agentic AI system.

### Features Implemented this Week:

* Integrated `pg-vector` to support vector storage and search functionalities.
* Improved webcam simulation to enhance realism in Unity simulation.
* Developed initial basic version of an Agentic AI Module for drone control and scene understanding.

### Tech stack

* Unity 3D
* Python (FastAPI, PyTorch)
* PostgreSQL (`pg-vector`)
* Docker and Docker Compose
* WebSocket and RESTful APIs for communication

### Setup instructions

Clone the repository and follow the steps below:

```bash
git clone <repository-link>
cd <project-directory>
docker-compose up --build
```

*Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.*
