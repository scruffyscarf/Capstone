# **Week #4**

## Testing and QA

We conducted local tests to verify the implemented connection between the backend server and drone client. The tests involved submitting various invalid inputs to evaluate system stability and robustness. The interactions between Docker containers have been validated to ensure smooth operation. Additionally, a Dockerfile for the client has been created to streamline and simplify the testing process.

### Evidence of test execution

* Local tests demonstrated stability with invalid input scenarios.
* Docker container interactions validated.
* Dockerfile for client prepared to facilitate testing.

## Deployment

### Staging

The implemented solution has been successfully deployed and tested in a staging environment. The deployment simulated interaction by an external user attempting to communicate with the drone client through the backend server.

## Vibe Check

The team remains energized and enthusiastic, anticipating significant progress and future success.

# Weekly commitments

## Individual contribution of each participant

* Initiated development of the agentic AI based on point cloud data previously generated by our pipeline.
* Successfully implemented a stable connection between the backend server and the drone client, enabling drone control and image requests from the simulation.

## Plan for Next Week

* Conduct extensive testing of the established server-client connection.
* Enhance agentic AI capabilities for operation through the backend server.
* Progress towards achieving a full interaction chain: client ↔ LLM ↔ agentic AI via backend server.

## Confirmation of the code's operability

We confirm that the code in the main branch:

-  Is in working condition.
    
-  Runs via docker-compose (as described in the `README.md`).
