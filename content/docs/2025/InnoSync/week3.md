## ü§ñ Machine Learning (QuickSyncing)

We enhanced the recommendation engine that powers QuickSyncing by introducing a **team synergy metric** and deploying a lightweight API.

**Link to the training code**: [View Code](https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/InnoSync/blob/main/ML/recommender.py)

### ‚úÖ Improvements Made
- Added **team synergy scoring** using **Jaccard similarity** to assess how well candidates complement each other.
- Implemented **content-based filtering** using:
  - **TF-IDF vectorization** on skill descriptions.
  - **Cosine similarity** to match job requirements with candidate profiles.
- Built and deployed a **FastAPI microservice** to expose the model as an endpoint for backend integration.

### How The Model Works
- The Model uses content-based filtering by using TF-IDF vectorization to convert skills (text) into numerical weights. Then we use cosine similarity between job requirements and candidate skills. We also evaluate team synergy using Jaccard similarity. Also, added FastAPI for integration with backend.

**Links to the initial model artifacts**
- Mock data for jobs [View Code](https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/InnoSync/blob/main/ML/team_jobs.csv)
- Mock data for candidates [View Code](https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/InnoSync/blob/main/ML/team_candidates.csv)
- FastAPI App [View Code](https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/InnoSync/blob/main/ML/app.py)

## üß™ Internal demo

### üîç Demo Summary
We conducted an internal demo of the MVP to test the entire end-to-end user flow from both Recruitee and Recruiter perspectives.

### ‚úÖ What Worked Well
- **Authentication system** was fully functional: sign up, log in, and session persistence worked as expected.
- **Profile creation** guided users step-by-step and stored data correctly.
- **Talent search and filtering** on the Recruiter side successfully returned Recruitees.
- **Project search and application flow** on the Recruitee side was responsive and filtered results accurately.
- **ML FastAPI integration** was functional locally, returning basic candidate recommendations.

### üêû Identified Issues / Bugs
- Profile creation form UX needs slight refinements.
- Filtering and searching pages for both recruitee and recruiters are not responsive and need more refined design.
- Some validation messages are not clearly displayed.

### üîß Immediate Action Points
- Improve UI/UX of forms (auto-focus fields, better error display).
- Fix inconsistencies in filtering results.
- Removing the role based feature and make everyone can act as recruiter and recruitee.
- Run another internal walkthrough post-patches before demoing externally.

### Product Design
- Conducted UX research to identify pain points and inefficiencies in the existing design and application flow [[View Docs Link]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MQrfwRCKrIERXYb7NTF-UlpgPONcMYxe_SBkxnDiKsw/edit?usp=sharing)

### CustDev
- Researched and formulated customer Journey Map [[View Docs Link]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kQEwIuQKmiQhXhjXWIOvx3K1JsMtacv6KoPEj-hRHkU/edit?tab=t.0)
