# üõ° DevOps Improvements

## üìä Monitoring & Logging

To ensure robust observability and maintainability of the deployed services, we have integrated the following tools:

- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**  
  Used for centralized logging. Logs from containers and services are collected and shipped to Logstash, indexed in Elasticsearch, and visualized via Kibana dashboards. This helps us trace application behavior and debug issues effectively.

- **Prometheus + Grafana**  
  Prometheus is used to scrape and store time-series metrics from various components. Grafana is connected to Prometheus to provide real-time dashboards, giving insights into service and system performance.

- **Node Exporter**  
  Installed alongside Prometheus to expose hardware and OS-level metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk I/O from the host machine.

- **Alertmanager**  
  Integrated with Prometheus to handle alerting rules. It sends alerts via Telegram based on specific metric thresholds, enabling faster incident response and minimizing downtime.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Server Configuration

We optimized the deployment environment with the following configurations:

- **Nginx Reverse Proxy**  
  Nginx is configured to serve as a reverse proxy, forwarding HTTPS traffic from users to the backend services. This centralizes traffic routing and simplifies exposure of internal services.

- **SSL via Let's Encrypt**  
  Secure HTTPS communication is enabled using certificates issued by Let‚Äôs Encrypt. This ensures that all data transferred between the client and server is encrypted and secure.

- **Dockerized Deployment**  
  The entire application, including backend, frontend, and monitoring tools, is containerized using Docker. Services are orchestrated using `docker-compose` to simplify development, testing, and production deployment.

# üé® Product Design Enhancements

Our product design process focused on creating a smooth, intuitive, and accessible user experience for both desktop and mobile platforms. The design work was led by the frontend and product design team members in collaboration with feedback from customer development sessions.

## üñ• Desktop Application Design

- We developed a complete **high-fidelity desktop UI** in Figma, reflecting the final visual look and layout of the application.  
- The design includes all major user flows: registration/login, project creation, profile management, project browsing, invitation handling, and filtering.
- This Figma file was used as the **single source of truth** for frontend implementation, ensuring visual consistency across components.
- Link: [High-Fidelity Desktop Design](https://www.figma.com/design/qDq1rHa8D5f1AlJtMBb0rz/High-Fi-design-InnoSync?node-id=0-1&t=ipSTIA94kiUU0fP1-1)

## üì± Mobile Application Concept

- A mobile version of the platform was conceptualized to explore future extensibility and enhance user accessibility.
- The design is presented in **low-fidelity wireframes**, focusing on layout structure, user interaction patterns, and adapting features to smaller screens.
- This concept ensures our design system is responsive and considers on-the-go use cases for project browsing, receiving invites, or quick applications.
- Link: [Mobile UX Concept ‚Äì UX Research](https://www.figma.com/design/islrijonPzZEUrBi9NgV94/UX-UI-Mid?node-id=47-31994&t=bATNSWtlbjcDZmov-1)

## üîÑ Iterative Design Process

- Designs were updated incrementally based on user feedback collected through customer interviews and usability testing.
- We prioritized simplicity, clear visual hierarchy, and ease of navigation‚Äîespecially in pages involving filtering and forms (like project creation and profile editing).
- The team ensured that color contrast, button placements, and content readability met accessibility guidelines where possible.
