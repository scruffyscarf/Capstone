## üß™ Testing and QA

### Summary of testing strategy and types of tests implemented

Our testing strategy focuses on ensuring functionality at both the unit and integration levels. This week, we implemented the following:

- **Unit Tests:**  
  - Developed using **JUnit 5** to validate isolated components and business logic.  
  - Covered core methods in services and utility classes.

- **Integration Tests:**  
  - Used **Mockito** to mock dependencies where needed.  
  - Verified end-to-end behavior between services, repositories, and the database layer.

- **Test Coverage Strategy:**  
  - Focused on critical logic paths and potential edge cases.  
  - Aimed to detect regressions early during development and integration phases.

- **Tools used:**  
  - `JUnit 5` for testing framework  
  - `Mockito` for mocking and verifying interactions  
  - No static analysis tools were used during this phase.


### Evidence of test execution

## CI/CD

We implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.

- CI (Continuous Integration) runs backend and frontend tests on every push or pull_request to main or develop.
- CD (Continuous Deployment) is triggered only on `main` after tests pass. It securely connects to our Yandex Cloud VDS via SSH and runs docker compose up -d --build to deploy the new version.

### Tools used
- GitHub Actions  
- SSH deployment via [appleboy/ssh-action](https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action)  
- Docker & Docker Compose  
- Yandex Cloud VM (VDS)

### Challenges faced
- Git remote conflict when tracking long nested branches (resolved with git remote prune origin)  
- SSH deployment required manual key generation and GitHub secrets configuration  
- Ensuring proper test environments across both backend (Java 21, Maven) and frontend (Node.js, Next.js)
- Couldn't find domain name for free, this task in progress yet, to get domain name for free.

---

## Deployment

### Staging

The application is deployed on a Yandex Cloud virtual server (VDS). The server hosts both frontend and backend containers using Docker Compose.

- Backend: Spring Boot (Java 21) running on port 8080  
- Frontend: Next.js app on port 3000  
- Reverse proxy: NGINX to handle routing and public access  
- CI/CD: Deploys automatically from GitHub on every main push  

Public access is available via the server's public IP address [View Here](http://51.250.42.156:3000) . Domain configuration is in progress, because we couldn't find it for free yet.

### Production

‚ö†Ô∏è _Bonus not yet implemented_

Plans for future:
- Assign a custom domain name 
- Add HTTPS using Let's Encrypt and Certbot  
- Separate staging and production environments on different ports or VMs  
- Use Docker and NGINX for robust deployment  

_This section will be updated in a future report._

## Vibe Check

- Held a dedicated team sync to assess workload, morale, and communication.
- Overall team mood is **positive** ‚Äî members reported strong collaboration and task ownership.
- Main challenge raised: occasional backend-frontend sync delays during integration.
- Agreed on better scheduling of integration checkpoints to avoid blockers.
- Everyone feels aligned with the project goals and comfortable voicing concerns.
- Committed to maintaining transparent, supportive team dynamics.

## Machine Learning

Discussed the integration with the backend and updated the data models for both projects and candidates to align with the database schema. Additionally, the ML model application was dockerized to streamline deployment and ensure consistency across environments.

## Product Design

- Refined UI for **Dashboard**, **Find Talents**, and **Find Projects** based on feedback.
- Integrated user feedback from usability tests into Figma updates.
- Maintained alignment between design and code using Cursor + Figma MCP.
- Researched and did QuickSync Design Layout.

## AI Agents Utilization: Cursor with Model Context Protocols (MCP)

### Overview

During this week, we utilized **Cursor** in conjunction with **Model Context Protocols (MCP)** to implement several features and tasks ‚Äî primarily on the frontend.

We specifically used the [Figma Context MCP](https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP), a server designed for Cursor. This MCP simplifies and translates Figma API responses into model-relevant layout and styling data, allowing Cursor to generate the structural HTML/CSS for a page directly from Figma designs.

---

### Features and Tasks Completed with Cursor

- Implementation of the **Dashboard Page**
- Implementation of the **Find Project Page**
- Implementation of the **Find Talents Page**
- **Responsiveness implementation** for the **Login** and **Signout Pages**

---

### MCP Integration Workflow

The MCP was used to extract styling and structure data from Figma. Work was conducted **frame by frame** to maximize the effectiveness of Cursor‚Äôs code generation. This granular approach helped in maintaining precision and consistency with the original design specifications.

---

### Productivity Impact

#### ‚úÖ Advantages

- **Facilitated straightforward design implementation**: Especially effective for designs with minimal components or simpler structures.
- **Accelerated repetitive frontend tasks**: Tasks like setting up filtering mechanisms, button logic, and basic layout configurations were significantly faster.
- **Motivational boost**: Cursor‚Äôs ability to produce near-correct outputs reduced procrastination, making it easier to get started and iterate quickly.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disadvantages

- **Incorrect file placement**: Cursor occasionally placed correct code into the wrong files. If unnoticed early, these issues became hard to track and resolve.
- **Poor adherence to coding conventions**: Solutions sometimes worked technically but did not align with best practices or established code organization guidelines.
- **Duplicate or unnecessary component creation**: Cursor occasionally introduced redundant components or modified unrelated files, potentially causing long-term codebase conflicts.
- **Limited maintainability**: While the generated code often worked, it lacked flexibility and was sometimes hard to refactor or extend later.

---

### Productivity Metrics

- **Responsiveness & Filtering Features**:  
  Cursor provided a **20‚Äì25% productivity boost**, significantly reducing development time for UI logic and responsiveness.

- **Complex Page Implementations (Dashboard, Find Talents, Find Project)**:  
  Cursor contributed a **5‚Äì10% development boost**. These pages contained numerous components and complex interactions, where Cursor often struggled to accurately replicate the designs. Multiple iterations, developer intervention, and manual refactoring were required to complete the tasks to standard.

---

### Summary

Using Cursor with the Figma MCP delivered a noticeable productivity increase for isolated, straightforward frontend tasks. However, for more complex pages and scalable features, developer supervision and involvement remained critical to ensure maintainable, clean, and well-structured code.
