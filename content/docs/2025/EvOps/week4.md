# **Week #4**

## Testing and QA

### Automated Testing of the Back End

### Manual Testing of the Android Application

- **Testing Method:** manual testing was conducted without documented checklists
  or test cases, as QA worked independently.
- **Reasoning:** manual testing was chosen to save time since only one
  regression test is planned (at the end of the course) and the appâ€™s design is
  rapidly evolving, making UI test automation inefficient.
- **Results:** four bugs were identified
  ([bug report 1](https://github.com/orgs/evops-sum25/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=116973603&issue=evops-sum25%7Cevops-android%7C22),
  [bug report 2](https://github.com/orgs/evops-sum25/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=117538274&issue=evops-sum25%7Cevops-android%7C28),
  [bug report 3](https://github.com/orgs/evops-sum25/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=118202715&issue=evops-sum25%7Cevops-android%7C30),
  [bug report 4](https://github.com/orgs/evops-sum25/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=118203273&issue=evops-sum25%7Cevops-android%7C31))
- **Mobile Specific Features Tested:**
  - The application retains state after screen rotation and theme changes.
  - A network disconnection does not terminate the app.

### Evidence of Test Execution

## CI/CD

**CI:**

Our CI/CD is configured via
[GitHub Actions.](https://github.com/features/actions) All configuration files
are placed in the [main repository](https://github.com/evops-sum25/evops). There
are three CI files for the three major submodules of our project. Here are their
workflows:

**Back End / ML Server:**

1. Install the stable Rust toolchain and Protobuf compiler.
2. Run `cargo check` to check if the code can build.
3. Run `cargo test` to execute unit, integration, and documentation tests.
4. Run `cargo fmt --all --check` to check whether the code is formatted.
5. Run `cargo clippy -all-targets` to catch common lints.

**Website:**

1. Set up Node.js and pnpm.
2. Get the pnpm store path and cache the dependencies.
3. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `pnpm lint` to catch common lints.
5. Run `pnpm test` to test the code.
6. Run `pnpm typecheck` to check type safety.

**CD:**

Our Continuous Deployment is configured in a single file. Its workflow should be
triggered manually in the GitHub UI because of the `on: workflow_dispatch`
setting in the CD configuration file. Here is the workflow:

1. Install `sshpass` to run SSH using the keyboard-interactive password
   authentication mode, but in a non-interactive way.
2. Connect to our server using the secret variables weâ€™ve set in the repository
   settings.
3. Fetch updates and update submodules.
4. Rebuild and rerun the Docker containers.

## Deployment

### Staging

A prototype instance of our application is hosted on a server that we bought on
[HostVDS](https://hostvds.com/). For the Continuous Deployment file, weâ€™ve set
these environment variables in our repository:

- `SERVER_USER`: Unix username.
- `SSH_PASSWORD`: Unix password.
- `PROJECT_PATH`: filesystem path to the project.
- `SEVER_HOST`: IP address of the server.

As was mentioned in the CI/CD part, we trigger the deployment workflow manually.
It helps us avoid unnecessary rebuilds and gives us more control over our
deployment.

### Production

Due to the self-hosted nature of our project, we are not supposed to have a
single production instance. For the purposes of the Capstone Project course, you
can think of our staging deployment (described above) as the production
instance. However, the plan has always been to allow users to host their own
EvOps in-house.

## Vibe Check

The vibe check was successfully conducted during the last team meeting, where we
enjoyed delicious barbecue. ðŸ˜‹

Team health check results: _very positive vibe_. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’¯

There has been good progress overall, and no major obstacles have been
identified. Some members indicated that they might require assistance with their
designated task. Consequently, team members will be offering each other support.

Team dynamics remain healthy, with open communication and effective
collaboration. All members have participated actively and felt comfortable
sharing.
