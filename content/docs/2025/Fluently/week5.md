# **Week #5**

## Feedback

### Sessions

<!-- _Conduct at least three sessions with potential users, describe detailed user reviews here (potential users should NOT be your team members)._ -->

- _It will be greate to customize personal lessons plan from settings_
- _The design of the app is pretty simple and looks good. But i think that it will be good to add picture to the background corresponding to the learning goal_
- _The word database is huge and really helpful, but more variety in exercises would make lessons even better_
- _It will be good to add pronounce training to words from dictionary and custom lessons for words from non-learned group_
- _Loggin system is simple, but i think that it will be good to add other services for loggin_

### Analyze

<!-- _Describe the important points that you received from the user feedback, what issues and with which priority you created._ -->

- The customization of the lessons will be added to profile as soon as possible
- Since some models of the lessons are not made yet, we are going to implement them at the next week
- The idea of the repeating words from dictionary is good one, we will discuss about it

## Iteration & Refinement

### Implemented features based on feedback

- Discuss profile settings that we will have
- Discuss exercise versions
- Discuss word repeatitions

### Performance & Stability

<!-- _How would you measure the performance of your application? Calculate the metrics that are suitable for your project and find out if they can be improved in any way, if necessary._ -->
