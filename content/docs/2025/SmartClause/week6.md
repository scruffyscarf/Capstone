## Final deliverables

### Project overview

SmartClause is a comprehensive AI-powered legal document analysis platform focused on the Russian legal market. The platform leverages RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology with legal vector databases to provide intelligent document analysis and interactive legal consultation capabilities. 

**Key Problems Solved:**
- **Document Risk Analysis**: Automated identification of legal risks, compliance issues, and unfavorable terms in contracts
- **Legal Consultation**: Interactive AI assistant providing professional-level legal advice with conversation memory
- **Knowledge Access**: Semantic search through Russian legal rules with natural language queries
- **User Workflow**: Complete document processing pipeline from upload to detailed analysis and consultation

**Target Users:** Legal professionals, freelancers, small business owners, and individuals who need professional contract review without expensive legal consultation fees.

### Features

### Setup instructions

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Python 3.11+
- OpenRouter API key ([Get one here](https://openrouter.ai/))
- 8GB+ RAM recommended for embedding processing

**Step-by-step setup:**

1. **Clone Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/SmartClause.git
cd SmartClause
```

2. **Download Legal Datasets** (~1.2GB total)
```bash
python analyzer/scripts/download_datasets.py
```

3. **Configure Environment**
```bash
# Copy environment templates
cp analyzer/env.example analyzer/.env
cp chat/env.example chat/.env

# Edit both .env files and add your OpenRouter API key and jwt secret
# Replace 'your_openrouter_api_key_here' with actual key
# Replace 'your_jwt_secret_here' with actual secret
```

4. **Launch Platform**
```bash
# Build and start all services (first launch ~10-15 minutes)
docker-compose up --build -d

# Monitor startup process
docker-compose logs -f
```

5. **Initialize Database and Load Legal Dataset**
```bash
# Load complete legal dataset (413k+ chunks with embeddings)
docker-compose exec analyzer python scripts/process_and_upload_datasets.py --upload --clear
```

6. **Access the Application**
- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:8080
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000/swagger-ui/index.html
- **Analyzer API**: http://localhost:8001/docs
- **Chat API**: http://localhost:8002/docs

**Production Deployment:**
The platform is deployed using Jenkins CI/CD pipeline with automated builds and deployments to production server via SSH. SSL certificates and domain configuration are managed through the deployment infrastructure.

## Deployment

### Staging

**Staging Environment Process:**

Our staging environment serves as a testing ground before production deployment, ensuring code quality and stability through automated testing and manual validation.

**Infrastructure Setup:**
- **Environment**: Local development servers and Docker containers
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing, feature validation, and integration testing
- **Configuration**: Mirrors production setup but with test databases and mock external services

**Staging Pipeline:**
- **Trigger**: Pull requests and feature branch merges to develop branch
- **Process**:
  1. Automated tests run on microservices (Python analyzer service and Java backend service)
  2. Docker images built with staging configuration
  3. Services deployed to staging environment
  4. Integration tests executed
  5. Manual testing and validation performed
  6. Performance and security checks conducted

**Testing Environment:**
- **Database**: Isolated test database with sample data
- **External Services**: Mock APIs and test configurations
- **Monitoring**: Basic logging and health checks for validation
- **Access Control**: Limited access for development team and stakeholders

### Production

**Production Deployment Process:**

Our production environment is hosted on **Yandex Cloud** using a Virtual Dedicated Server (VDS) instance with fully automated CI/CD pipeline through Jenkins.

**Infrastructure Setup:**
- **Cloud Provider**: Yandex Cloud VDS (158.160.190.57)
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Domain**: Purchased and managed through reg.ru
- **SSL Certificate**: SSL certificate obtained and configured for secure HTTPS connections
- **Reverse Proxy**: Apache HTTP Server configured as a reverse proxy to route traffic to containerized services

**CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins):**
- **Trigger**: Pushes and merges to main branch automatically trigger deployment
- **Automated Pipeline Stages**:
  1. **Checkout**: Jenkins pulls latest code from repository
  2. **Parallel Testing**: 
     - Python Service: Tests analyzer microservice using Python 3.11 container with cached dependencies
     - Java Service: Tests backend microservice using Maven 3.9.6 with Eclipse Temurin 21
  3. **Auto-Deploy**: Upon successful tests, automatic deployment to production server via SSH
     - Fetches latest main branch code
     - Builds frontend using custom build script
     - Recreates Docker containers with latest images
     - Ensures zero-downtime deployment

**Production Environment Configuration:**
- **Containerization**: All services run in Docker containers orchestrated by docker-compose
- **Network Security**: Apache proxy handles external traffic, internal services communicate through Docker network
- **SSL Termination**: Apache handles SSL termination, ensuring encrypted connections
- **Port Management**: Only necessary ports (80, 443) exposed externally, internal services isolated
- **Automated Deployment**: SSH-based deployment with key authentication for secure access

**Public Access:**
- **Domain**: Custom domain name registered through reg.ru
- **SSL**: Full SSL/TLS encryption enabled for all communications
- **High Availability**: Production server configured for stable 24/7 operation with automated deployment pipeline
