**Kirill Karsakov**: Created an initial backlog with prioritized features/tasks; thought about questions for the survey; wrote the project report

## Plan for Next Week

1. Core Feature Implementation:
    * Frontend and Backend developers collaborate to implement the highest priority features from the backlog.
    * Focus on making at least one end-to-end user journey functional.
    * Implement basic error handling.
    * User authentication/authorization.
2. API Integration: Connect frontend components to backend APIs.
3. Data Persistence: Ensure data is being correctly stored and retrieved from the database.
4. Internal Demo & Feedback: Conduct an internal team demo of the current state. Identify bugs and areas for immediate
   improvement.

## Confirmation of the code's operability

We confirm that the code in the main branch:
- [x] In working condition.
- [x] Run via docker-compose (or another alternative described in the `README.md`).
