# **Week #4**

## Testing and QA

#### By level of testing
1. Unit Testing
2. Integration Testing
3. Mock Strategy

##### Frontend Testing Infrastructure
- **Vitest** configuration with jsdom environment
- **Global test setup** with mocked localStorage and environment variables
- **Test scripts** in package.json for running tests in different modes
- **Path aliases** support for clean imports in tests

### Evidence of test execution

### Frontned

## CI/CD

We used `render.com` as a primary cloud-based platform for deploying and hosting our code. Also, we used GitHub actions as a CI/CD tool. One of the most tough challenge was to deploy frontend with environment variables. We overcame that using first build then deploy method.

## Deployment

### Staging

For staging environment we use render.com, we have github actions triggers
(`backend develop` and `frontend develop` pipelines). These helps create preview environments of services, 
these actions trigger on creating PR to the main branch, so we can preview all changes without redeploying 
the production build.

[backend dev](https://projector-backend-dev.onrender.com)
[frontend dev](https://frontend-develop-132n.onrender.com)

### Production
For production we also use render.com. Deploy pipelines triggers on push to the `main` branch

[frontend](https://projector-1.onrender.com)
[backend](https://projector-bp8n.onrender.com)

## Vibe Check

The team is on track with current goals and deliverables. Milestones are being met as planned, and overall velocity is consistent. No major blockers have been reported.

No critical roadblocks at the moment. Minor issues are being handled within the team without escalation. Weâ€™re maintaining good communication to catch any potential risks early.
