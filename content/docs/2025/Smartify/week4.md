# **Week #4**

## CI/CD

The pipeline does the following:

- Responds to push or pull_request in main
- Establishes an SSH connection to a remote server using a secret key
- Copies the project (docker-compose.yml, backend, frontend, database, ml) to the server
- Performs on the server:
  - docker-compose build ‚Äî collects
  - docker images-compose up -d
- Deletes the key after completion for security

### Links to CI/CD configuration files
[Here](https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/Smartify/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml) is the CI/CD configuration file

## Deployment

What's unfolding:
- backend/ - a backend service 
- frontend/ ‚Äî an interface
- ml/ ‚Äî ML model
- database/ ‚Äî databases
- docker-compose.yml ‚Äî binds all services in containers

Where it is deployed:
- Remote server with IP 213.226.112.206
- Under the user ghrunner
- To the /pro/smartify directory

How:
- The SCP files are copied first.
- Then on the server:
  - The project is being built with the docker-compose build
  - It starts with docker-compose up -d

## Vibe Check

Everything is going well with the team. We're all on track and managing to meet our deadlines smoothly. Everyone is contributing effectively, and there are no major roadblocks at the moment. The team dynamics are positive, and communication is clear, so we are confident that we will continue to work constantly. Since our project is quite voluminous and involves constant use by people, we try to fill it with various features as much as possible.
