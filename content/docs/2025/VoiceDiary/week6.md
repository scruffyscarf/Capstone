##  Project Overview

**Voice Diary** is a voice-based journaling application designed to make emotional self-tracking more natural, engaging, and insightful. Unlike traditional text-based mood trackers, this app lets users record short voice messages and uses AI to analyze vocal tone and content to determine the **"Emotion of the Day"**, provide **personalized recommendations**, and identify **emotional patterns over time**.

This app is intended for users who are interested in monitoring their emotional wellbeing but want a more interactive and personalized experience. It leverages voice as a natural medium for expression and uses machine learning models to extract emotional insights.

### ‚úÖ Solves the Problem of:
- Low engagement in mood tracking apps
- Lack of personalization in emotional wellness tools
- Time-consuming journaling habits
