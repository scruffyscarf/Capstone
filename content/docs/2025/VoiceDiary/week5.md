# Feedback

## Sessions 

    1. "Convenient and beautiful interface, intuitively clear where to click. The site is gorgeous. The output wasn‚Äôt very clear to me, but I used it just for fun‚Äîit was interesting to see something come out. It‚Äôs fascinating to observe how the neural network reacts to my input. I haven‚Äôt tried the voice AI yet, but it seems intriguing."

    2. "I visited the site‚Äîit‚Äôs beautiful, and at first glance, it seemed like something serious. I tried speaking into it, and while the topics were somewhat relevant, the psychological insights didn‚Äôt quite fit me. The results were in English even though I spoke in Russian. I‚Äôd use it more if the app were higher quality."

    3. "The concept is cool, and the design is modern, but the responses sometimes don't match. I would like if it could all be edited, because I would like to use it daily, sometimes the emotion is not accurate. Also, adding multilingual support would make it more accessible."

## Analize

### Strengths  
‚úÖ **UI/UX praised** ‚Äì Users highlight the intuitive, visually appealing interface.  
‚úÖ **Engagement potential** ‚Äì Some interact "for fun," showing interest in observing AI behavior.  
‚úÖ **Voice input curiosity** ‚Äì Ineresting feature.  

### Pain Points  
‚ö† **Output clarity issues** ‚Äì Confusion over results (e.g., psychological insights feeling mismatched).  
‚ö† **Language mismatch** ‚Äì Russian input yielding English outputs reduces usability.  
‚ö† **Perceived lack of depth** ‚Äì Feedback suggests responses can feel low-quality.  

## Actionable Improvements  

### High Priority  
üîß **Customizable output fields** ‚Äì Add emotion editing possibility (to correct when the model is wrong)

üîß **Input-language consistency** ‚Äì Warn users that product functionality is in English.  

### Mid/Long-Term  
üåç **Multilingual support** ‚Äì Currently high effort; requires deeper pipeline changes.  
ü§ñ **Emotion recognition improvement** ‚Äì Refinine context retention, improve emotion recognition.  

### Additional Notes  
- Some users treat the tool as entertainment‚Äîcould lean into this with a "playful mode" variant. 

## Iteration & Refinement

The product is fully functional and stable in production. While we‚Äôre actively addressing minor issues, the core system performs reliably. Next week, we‚Äôll implement several researched features to enhance functionality.
### üìå Key Progress Highlights:

    Performance & Stability: Rigorous testing has ensured a robust foundation. Remaining issues are edge cases (e.g., rare latency spikes) being prioritized for fixes.

    ML Model Refinement:

        Emotional Insights: Discovered a more accurate approach for emotion analysis (higher precision/recall).

        Orchestration: Finalizing multi-model pipelines for end-to-end emotional recognition.

    Documentation:

        Structured Guides: READMEs in /frontend and /ml detail setup, architecture, and workflows.

        Experimental Work: /experimental includes R&D notes for upcoming features.

#### Next Steps:

    Deploy refined emotional recognition models.

    Optimize API handoffs between backend/ML services.
