## Final deliverables

### Project overview
#### Project Description

GoalSight is an AI-powered web platform serving as a centralized hub for football analytics. It aggregates advanced statistics from reliable sources like WhoScored, providing intuitive tools for users such as coaches, fans, and journalists to analyze teams, matches, and tournaments efficiently. The focus is on simplifying data access, enabling quick insights, and enhancing engagement through predictive features.

##### Problems It Solves

GoalSight tackles common challenges in football data handling:

- Coaches spend excessive time manually collecting data from various platforms for match preparation and training.
- Fans struggle with accessing clear, advanced stats for teams and tournaments, which reduces their engagement.
- Journalists and analysts waste effort on verifying and organizing data from fragmented, hard-to-navigate sources.
- Overall fragmentation leads to inefficiencies, lost strategic opportunities, and lower interaction with valuable football data.


##### Key Features
- **Interactive Visualizations and Summaries**: View basic team statistics like goals, possession, and xG upon expanding a team.
- **Intuitive Search and Filtering**: Easily select teams and metrics for quick overviews and comparisons.
- **AI-Based Match Predictions**: Select any two teams to generate real-time probabilities for win, draw, or loss, based on historical data.
- **Upcoming Matches Overview**: Home page displays a list of future games with predicted win probabilities.
- **Centralized Data Hub**: User-friendly interface integrating stats from APIs, with navigation for all user types.


### Features
- Home page displaying upcoming matches (e.g., FIFA Club World Cup 2025 fixtures) with win probability percentages.
- Team selection interface for choosing two teams from a list (e.g., Real Madrid, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain) to run AI predictions.
- Real-time match forecast generation, showing outcomes like "Real Madrid vs Juventus: 32% - 67%".
- Expandable team views revealing basic statistics such as goals, possession, and xG.
- Integration with data APIs (e.g., WhoScored) for aggregating reliable football metrics.
- Simple predictor explanation: Steps to select teams and get AI-powered match probabilities.
- Basic navigation including home, tournament views, and predictor tool.


### Tech stack
Technology:
- **Frontend:** Node.js 18, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Axios for API calls
- **Backend:** Python, Django
- **Database:** PostgresDB
- **Other tools:** REST API


### Setup instructions

#### Quick Start

##### Using Docker

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/GoalSight.git
   cd GoalSight
   ```
2. Decrypt the environment variables file:
   ```bash
   cd docker/local
   gpg --decrypt .env.gpg > .env
   ```
   > You will need a password to decrypt. If you don't have it, contact the [team lead](https://github.com/Arino4kaMyr).
3. Start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
- Backend: http://localhost:8000/
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000/



### Plan for the live demo.
1. **Start at the Home Page**
2. **Show Team Stats Functionality**
3. **Navigate to the Predictor/Teams Page**
3. **Demonstrate AI Predictor**
4. **Interactive Q&A**
