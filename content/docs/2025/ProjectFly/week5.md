## Feedback

Through Alexander Maloletov (Director of the Robotics Development Center in Innopolis), we agreed that upon completion of the order, the project participants will receive a lump sum payment.

## Iteration & Refinement

### Performance & Stability

When the magnet slides post reed switches, there is a chance to get a value equal to 0. This is due to the current solution and design. There is a metric associated with the gaps between switches. <br />
An iteration solution would be to reduce the size of reed switches to such an extent that a negligibly small gap between the switches is reached, which would guarantee a constant and unambiguously set position of the float.

## Plan for Next Week

- Build the microcontroller board
- Complete the prototype assembly
- Ð¡ontact the customer to confirm our product solution

## Confirmation of the code's operability

We confirm that the code in the main branch:
- [x] In working condition.
- [x] Run via docker-compose (or another alternative described in the `README.md`).
