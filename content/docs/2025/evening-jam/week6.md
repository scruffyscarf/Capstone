## Final deliverables

### Project overview

**Problem we intended to solve** was to create a game that provides an enjoyable and fascinating way to spend time with a creative but not overwlelming brain training and an easy-to-follow storyline.

**Our result** is a 2D puzzle-platformer game, which story takes place in a world of robot-like creatures whose source of life is an electical charge. Unfortunately, the power had been running out, so the expedition was sent off to find a new sources of energy, leaving the city fully de-energized. The player can experience exploring the town and learning about its inhabitants using the inventive light bulb mechanics. The atmosphere is built with a captivating, lightly philosophical story, beautiful paper-like style, and original music. 

### Features

- playable levels 
- original art design 
- interaction with light bulbs and NPCs, basic movement, jump pad, idle animation, in-level door/teleporter
- two original soundtracks and dialogues (will be added ASAP)
