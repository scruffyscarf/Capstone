## Final deliverables

### Project overview



**UniTrip** is an interactive Unity-based game that offers a virtual tour of Innopolis University.  
It is designed to help students, parents, and tourists explore university life even if they cannot visit it physically.

The player explores detailed 2.5D university locations, interacts with NPCs (students and professors), and participates in mini-quests and dialogues to learn more about student life, infrastructure, and feel the atmosphere of the university.

At the current stage, two locations are fully implemented â€” including quests, walking, and NPC interactions.

### Features

- âœ… Two fully functional locations:
  - **The outer hall**: 3 NPC's with dialogues, passing through metal detector and turnstile
  - **Main Hall**: 2 NPC's and 2 miniquests:
    - **Auditorium** - explore 108 room and find 3 objects
    - **Vending Machine Zone**: buy some snacks or drinks
- âœ… Dialogue system for NPC's (professors, guards and student)
- âœ… Scene transition system
- âœ… Character movement + interaction trigger zones
- âœ… 3D models and assets designed in Blender and Procreate
- âœ… Signal "!" and "i" sings to all interactions
- ðŸš§ Basic implementation of chat interface (UI without final design)
- ðŸš§ ML model for AI-guide (integration pending, will be completed before Sunday)

### Tech stack

- **Unity** 2022.3.56f1 â€” game engine
- **Blender** â€” 3D modeling of characters and environment
- **Procreate** â€” 2D design of characters, objects, and UI
- **C#** â€” scripting and logic
- **Google Drive** â€” collaborative design/documents
- **GitHub + GitHub Pages** â€” version control and deployment
- **LLM-based AI (planned)** â€” used for contextual dialogue (in progress)
